# Project Description 


This project is a simple aim training game made with Java and Swing where the player must click on the targets that appear on a (5x5) grid. The player has 3 targets to click at all times and clicking on a target will create a new target at a random location. Each target clicked will increase the score by 1 and missing the target will reset the score to 0. The game's aspects can be controlled in the code by changing the number of targets, the size of the grid, and the size of each cell.

This project includes the uses of Swing, Event listeners, and excellent implementations of OOP principles.
